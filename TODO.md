## Import the pgdump.txt from osdmaptool --test-map-pgs-dump-all to the simulation

Do I parse the pgdump.txt fully in c++?


## How do I generate the platform?

Preferably it should be generated dynamically from the same parameters as as the crushmap; or from the crushmap.


## How do I generate the deployment?

simgrid was organized so that it usually is handmade input for separation of concerns. But I have clear inputs so I could generate it from input parameters as well?


## add visualization of crushmaps to Snakemake

use the map-visualizer as base. Implement colors for unique DCs and make it part of the pipeline so it gets generated automatically
